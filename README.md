# FyloLandingPage Challenge
A landing page challenge from frontendmentor.

## Design Features:
- Optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

- Hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Project Description:
- In the challenge you supose to do the page just like the model with your own skills and knowledge.
- I didn't got acess to figma's design, only the design .jpg, so it isn't 100% like the model page, but i think i did a good job.

## Considerations:
- This is the second challenge i work on and i saw how i developed my HTML & CSS skills. I did this one way faster than the first challenge;
- Now i have a better logic to write more codes based in those languages;
- I still have a lot of practice and work to do before master those languages, but i'm enjoying very much to create content with them;
- As i said in previous challenge readme, I'm doing a **deep** dive in JS, to equal my skill levels. You can expect a JS project to be posted here ASAP;
